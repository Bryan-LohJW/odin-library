This exercise is to practice using objects to sort code nicely, however I am not very sure if this was the intended way that the code should work

However, I am proud of this project as it demonstrates my skill in building a simple form of data storage and manipulating the objects within using DOM manipulation and functions to give
a user friendly way to interact with the different 'books'. It was a good practice for both javascript as well as html and css

Although the project was not exactly as intended as what Odin wanted, I believe that the fundamentals required were met
